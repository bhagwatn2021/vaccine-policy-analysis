# Target population
Our goal is to find as many unvaccinated people 18 years and older residing in the United States as possible. We will be looking to vary our survey population by the following attributes:

- Race/ethnicity: We want to get more responses from marginalized races, such as Blacks and Hispanics. Evidence shows that microaggressions and mistreatment towards these races are preventing them from trusting the vaccine. We would like to find out the extent of these microaggressions and what policy will help to mitigate the issue. Gathering these would be achieved by reaching out to various faith and culture-based organizations (Neel was on the Executive Board of Hindu Students Association during undergrad and is able to reach out to the MSSC.)
- Political beliefs: Republicans are hostile towards taking the vaccine because of the anti-vaccine rhetoric conveyed by popular conservative media hosts and politicians. Gathering this data would be achieved by reaching out political organizations to GW Young Americas Foundation, GW College Democrats, and GW College Republicans to get ample results from around the political compass. 
- Income: Evidence also shows mistreatment towards groups of lower income. We want to find our more about the extent of microaggressions in this group and what policy would benefit. We can gather information from this population by asking GW students and others who fill out the survey about their income, and comparing that against who would favor different policies over COVID vaccinations. We can also reach out to the financial aid office to get more responses from people of underprivileged backgrounds as we are not violating ethical standards by doing so.

We be reaching out to the following people/groups to gain responses: 
- Dr. Lorien Abroms, a Public Health professor, runs the GW Health Communications Corps, an organization combating health misinformation. Dr. Abroms would particularly be integral with identifying groups of people that succumb to microaggressions and have lower vaccination rates*. Dr. Abroms can also help us gain more samples from groups that succumb to misinformation about the vaccine, as [a report from HHS in August 2021 estimates that 44% of unvaccinated fall into the "unvaccinated but willing" category](hhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/23/covid-unvaccinated-but-willing/?fbclid=IwAR26FWna18WL6-V__ofn441XM3cRf76NxEF6sWZdm-iNlO5q-his1OHocuk). This would help to reduce the bias in the sample towards a positive or negative policy, identifying a group of people that is willing to take the vaccine without any incentive or consequence wagered will help us identify the most efficient policy and whether incentives or fines are absolutely necessary. 
- Dr. Dennis Schell, a Psychology professor, teaches general and abnormal psychology. He also works with people with adverse behavior issues, and will be able to help garner surveys from people with behavioral health issues on why they won't take the vaccine. With these people in our sample, we will be able to identify whether they can comply with a vaccine mandate. 
- Dr. Patrick McHugh is a Professor of Management whose research is focused on the psychology behind organizational structure and operations. He will be able to identify organizations that do not require vaccinations for its members, and give insight as to the reception towards vaccine mandates. He can also help us identify organizations that incentivize decisions, which we can send the survey to. 
- No Lost Generation GW is an organization that helps refugees adjust to living in the United States, particularly in the DC area. We can talk to the organization about getting refugees vaccinated by translating the survey into various languages and allowing refugees and immigrants to take them. 
- Dr. Irene Foster is a Professor of Economics who can give insight on different unvaccinated populations in the US. She may be able to give contacts of people who work with the above groups to whom we can share the survey with.

Welcome and thank you for your interest in our survey! The purpose of this survey is to develop a quantitative model of consumer choice to inform the design decisions of a COVID vaccine policy. This survey is being conducted by students at The George Washington University for a Marketing Analytics course. You are invited to participate in this survey because you are a resident of the United States above the age of 18.

## Consent page

Your participation in this survey is voluntary. You may choose not to participate. If you decide to participate in this survey, you may withdraw at any time with no penalty. The procured involves filling an online survey that will take approximately 20 minutes. All responses will be used solely for educational purposes and individual identified information will not be shared under any circumstances. Your responses will be confidential and we do not collect identifying information such as your name, email address, or IP address.

By taking this survey, I certify that I am at least 18 years of age and will, to the best of my ability, answer truthfully and accurately. I understand that my answers may be invalidated should I fail to do so. I understand that I have read all of the above information and voluntarily agree to participate in this survey.

- I attest
- I do not attest

## Education information

This survey involves questions that ask whether a certain condition would result in you receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. These conditions can be seen as positive, negative, or neutral. These conditions will not actually occur and you will not need to take a COVID-19 vaccine based on your answers in this survey. All responses will be used purely for educational purposes. A type of question you may see would be the following: "Will you take a COVID-19 vaccine if given door-to-door?" This question is asking if you would take a COVID-19 vaccine if you had the option to take it at your doorstep. You may answer "Yes" or "No" to this question. At the end of the survey we will be collecting demographic information (such as income and age) that will also be used purely for educational purposes. These demographic attributes will help us account for bias in our data: 

- Race/ethnicity: data suggests that marginalized races may have a sense of mistrust in the American healthcare system, stemming from mistreatment to microaggressions towards these groups from practitioners. Collecting data from every ethic group allows us to compare the level of trust towards vaccines and infer it on COVID vaccination rates. 
- Political beliefs: conversations around COVID-19 have become increasingly political. We would like to gather data from people of all political beliefs to see the relationship between politics and the COVID vaccine. 
- Income: data suggests that people of lower income also are subjected to mistreatment and microaggressions by healthcare practitioners, also hampering trust in our healthcare system. Collecting data from various income groups also allows us to compare the level of trust towards vaccines and infer it on COVID vaccination rates.

If you have any questions about this survey, then please contact marketingvaccinepolicy@gmail.com.
