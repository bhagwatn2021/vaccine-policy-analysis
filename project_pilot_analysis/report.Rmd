# Abstract

This study focuses on the various policies that the US Federal government can enact to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates and stabilize the spread of COVID-19 with herd immunity. It compares a vaccine mandate enforced with a fine, the policy in question, to various incentives such as tax rebates and sporting tickets. It also takes into account the accessibility of vaccination centers, measured by the proximity of vaccination centers from residencies, as well as combinations of these different policy attributes. The target population for this study are all Americans 18 years and older who have not received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Below are lists of all possible values of each attribute included in the choice questions: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
incentive = c("Grocery Store Gift Card", "Internet Rebate", "Sporting Tickets", "Cash")
value = c(0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000)
penalty = c(0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000)
accessibility = c(0, 1, 3, 10) # Distance (miles) from a vaccination center

```
Accessibility (miles from residency): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
accessibility
```
Incentive (cateogrical): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
incentive
```
Mandate Fine (USD, no mandate for values of $0): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
penalty
```
Incentive Value (USD, no incentive for values of $0): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
value
```

# Introduction

Despite the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevented the United States from achieving herd immunity, the level of immunity that a population has to control the spread of a virus. Below is a chart depicting the number of daily vaccinations over time as a percentage of the population, followed by a chart depicting the percentage of the American population that is vaccinated:

</center>

In turn, the Delta variant, a highly-contagious strain of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, ravaged through unvaccinated populations and caused a surge in cases. 


### Accessibility

Accessibility refers to the distance which a vaccination clinic would be placed from your home. It varies with 0 (door-door vaccinations) - 10 miles from your residence. 


### Incentives

Incentives refers to the type of commodity that would be given out at tax season for being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline. It varies by cash tax rebates and cash equivalents (gift cards) redeemable at:

- Grocery stores
- Internet providers
- Professional sporting events 

### Incentive Value 

Incentive value refers to the value of commodities that would be given out at tax season for  being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline. It varies by increasing increments from $0 to $1000. 

### Penalty

Incentive value refers to the penalty due at tax season for failing to get a  being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline under a vaccine mandate. It varies by increasing increments from $0 to $1000. 

# Survey Design


# Pilot Data Analysis

p1 <- read_csv(here("data", "appleConjoint_p1.csv"))
p2 <- read_csv(here("data", "appleConjoint_p2.csv"))
p3 <- read_csv(here("data", "appleConjoint_p3.csv"))


# Changes to Final Survey

- We removed unnecessary images that may confuse respondents. 
- We wanted to find out how many people have experienced mistreatment in getting healthcare and see mandates for them, so we added a question asking this. 
- We changed the format of every question to a Yes/No multiple choice button to make the design look more appealing.
