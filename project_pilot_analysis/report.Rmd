# Abstract

This study focuses on the various policies that the US Federal government can enact to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates and stabilize the spread of COVID-19 with herd immunity. It compares a vaccine mandate enforced with a fine, the policy in question, to various incentives such as tax rebates and sporting tickets. It also takes into account the accessibility of vaccination centers, measured by the proximity of vaccination centers from residencies, as well as combinations of these different policy attributes. The target population for this study are all Americans 18 years and older who have not received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Below are lists of all possible values of each attribute included in the choice questions: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
incentive = c("Grocery Store Gift Card", "Internet Rebate", "Sporting Tickets", "Cash")
value = c(0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000)
penalty = c(0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000)
accessibility = c(0, 1, 3, 10) # Distance (miles) from a vaccination center

```
Accessibility (miles from residency): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
accessibility
```
Incentive (cateogrical): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
incentive
```
Mandate Fine (USD, no mandate for values of $0): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
penalty
```
Incentive Value (USD, no incentive for values of $0): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
value
```

# Introduction

Despite the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevented the United States from achieving herd immunity, the level of immunity that a population has to control the spread of a virus. Below is a chart depicting the number of daily vaccinations over time as a percentage of the population, followed by a chart depicting the percentage of the American population that is vaccinated:

</center>

In turn, the Delta variant, a highly-contagious strain of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, ravaged through unvaccinated populations and caused a surge in cases. 


### Accessibility

Accessibility refers to the distance which a vaccination clinic would be placed from your home. It varies with 0 (door-door vaccinations) - 10 miles from your residence. 


### Incentives

Incentives refers to the type of commodity that would be given out at tax season for being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline. It varies by cash tax rebates and cash equivalents (gift cards) redeemable at:

- Grocery stores
- Internet providers
- Professional sporting events 

### Incentive Value 

Incentive value refers to the value of commodities that would be given out at tax season for being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline. It varies by increasing increments from $0 to $1000. 

### Penalty

Incentive value refers to the penalty due at tax season for failing to get a  being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline under a vaccine mandate. It varies by increasing increments from $0 to $1000. 

# Survey Design

In order to see what sort of policy would be most appealing to those who are currently unvaccinated, the survey is designed to only collect responses from those would be able to choose to take the vaccine after seeing the policy options. This consists of adults 18 years or older who have not received any doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. This survey is also restricted to United States residents only, as this policy would only be directed towards United States residents.

The survey also collects demographic information relating to age, gender identity, race, income, political affiliation, and geographic location to better inform which policies are most effective for which demographics. Educational material presented to the respondents include information on accessibility, incentives, incentive value, and mandate value, which make up the survey's attributes.


- Accessibility ranged from 0-10 miles for the distance a vaccination clinic would be placed from a respondent's home. The accessibility range starts at 0 miles because it is in the most convenient spot possible for a respondent to receive a vaccine, and the range ends at 10 miles because most respondents should have a vaccination location outside of 10 miles from their home.
- Incentive value ranged from $0-$1000 to see if there was a value below $1000 that would sway more people to receive the vaccine. This range stopped at $1000, as anything above that number would most likely be infeasible to implement into a policy.
- Incentives were provided as cash or cash equivalents (gift cards) redeemable at grocery stores, internet providers, and professional sporting events. This range of incentives were chosen as they are items that are necessary and/or popular among the general public.
- Penalties ranged from $0-$1000 to see if there was a value below $1000 that would sway more people to receive the vaccine. This range stopped at $1000, as anything above that number would most likely be infeasible to implement into a policy.


Each respondent receives 10 choice questions that have two options "I will take the vaccine under these conditions" (where the conditions are listed in the option) and "I will not take the vaccine under these conditions". There is one alternative per choice question (the vaccine conditions) and a no-choice option, where respondents are informed that it means they would not take the vaccine under the conditions listed in the first alternative. An example figure of a random conjoint question can be seen below.


# Pilot Data Analysis

p2 <- read_csv(here("data", "appleConjoint_p2.csv"))
p3 <- read_csv(here("data", "appleConjoint_p3.csv"))

# Power Analysis

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(logitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(fastDummies)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(conjointTools)
options(dplyr.width = Inf) # So you can see all of the columns

# Load the data set:
data <- read_csv(here("data", "choiceData.csv"))

# Estimate the model
model <- estimateModels(
    nbreaks = 7,
    data   = data,
    pars   = c(
        "value", 
        "penalty",
        "accessibility",
        "incentive_cash",
        "incentive_grocery_store",
        "incentive_internet",
        "incentive_sport_tickets"
    ),
    outcome = "choice",
    obsID  = "obsID",
)

# Extract results
results <- getModelResults(model)

# Plot results
ggplot(results) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05, color = "black", linetype = 2) +
    geom_point(aes(x = sampleSize, y = se, color = coef)) +
    expand_limits(y = 0) +
    theme_bw() + 
    labs(title = "Power Analysis",
        x = "Sample Size", 
        y = "Standard Error", 
        color = "Coefficient"
    )
```

A power analysis of the pilot survey found that a sample of around 282 people would be necessary to obtain a standard error. The analysis found the standard error of a penalty to always be 0, which may increase once the survey receive more results from respondents. The sports tickets incentive seems to have the highest standard error with smaller sample sizes, which could be attributed to how sports tickets appeal to a certain demographic. This can be furthered by how the standard error decreases significantly as the sample size increases. As expected, a larger the sample size creates a smaller standard error for all variables (excluding penalty).


# Changes to Final Survey

- We removed unnecessary images that may confuse respondents. 
- We added a sentence that says I will take the vaccine under these conditions to make it more clear that the respondent is either choosing to take the vaccine under the conditions listed or not take it.
- We adjusted our attention checks to be less confusing.
- We removed our regional map question and decided to ask instead what state respondents are from and what type of area (urban, suburban rural) to understand their location better.

# Appendix

## Introduction

Welcome to our survey!

Thank you for your interest in our survey! The purpose of this survey is to to inform the design decisions of a COVID vaccine policy. This survey is being conducted by students at The George Washington University for a Marketing Analytics course. You must be a resident of the United States above the age of 18 who has not received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine to partake in this survey.   
          
This survey involves questions that ask whether a certain condition would result in you receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. These conditions can be seen as positive, negative, or neutral. These conditions will not actually occur and you will not need to actually take a COVID-19 vaccine based on your answers in this survey. All responses will be used purely for educational purposes. At the end of the survey we will be collecting demographic information (such as income and age) that will also be used purely for educational purposes.

If you have any questions about this survey, then please contact marketingvaccinepolicy@gmail.com.

## Education

Great work! Now that you've shared a bit about yourself, we'd like you to consider policies designed to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations. Let's learn about policy attributes.

### Accessibility

Accessibility refers to the distance in which a vaccination clinic would be placed from your home. It varies with 0 miles, 3 miles, 5 miles, and 10 miles from your residence. A distance of 0 miles indicates door-door in-residence vaccination campaigns.

### Incentives

Incentives refers to the type of commodity that would be given out at tax season for being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline. It varies by cash and cash equivalents (gift cards) redeemable at:

- Grocery stores
- Internet providers
- Professional sporting events 

### Incentive Value

Incentive value refers to the value of commodities that would be given out at tax season for  being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline. It varies by increasing increments from $0 to $1000. 

### Mandate Value

Mandate value refers to the penalty due at tax season for failing to get a  being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline under a vaccine mandate. It varies by increasing increments from $0 to $1000.


## Practice Question

We'll now begin with policy options. On the next few pages we will show you different combinations of policy options regarding COVID-19 vaccinations.

For example, if these were the only options available, would you choose option 1 (a $100 fine if you do not take the vaccine, a vaccination clinic 5 miles from your house, and a professional sporting event ticket) and take the vaccine or choose option 2 and not take the vaccine.

**Option 1**

**Mandate**: $100
**Accessibility**: 5 miles
**Incentive**: Professional sporting event

I will take the vaccine under these conditions.

**Option 2**

I will not take the vaccine under these conditions.

## Attention Check

This is an attention check. Please choose Option 1 and continue.

**Option 1**
**Option 2**
