# Great work!

Now that you've shared a bit about yourself, we'd like you to consider policies designed to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations. Let's learn about policy attributes. 

--- 

# Policy Attributes

Below is a description of the various policy attributes that will vary across every policy - each policy will be a combination of a universal vaccine mandate, enforced by a fine for not complying, different types of monetary incentives for complying, and the administration of vaccination clinics. Each attribute contains an associated image helping to explain the attribute.      

### Accessibility

Accessibility refers to the distance which a vaccination clinic would be placed from your home. It varies with 0 miles, 3 miles, 5 miles, and 10 miles from your residence. A distance of 0 miles indicates door-door in-residence vaccination campaigns.

### Incentives

Incentives refers to the type of commodity that would be given out at tax season as an incentive for being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline. It varies by cash (tax rebates) and cash equivalents (gift cards) redeemable at: 

- Grocery stores 
- Internet providers 
- Professional sporting events

</center>

### Incentive Value 

Incentive value refers to the monetary value of commodities that would be given out at tax season for being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline. It varies by increasing increments from $0 to $1000.

### Penalty

This value refers to the penalty due at tax season for failing to get a being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the tax return deadline under a vaccine mandate. It varies by increasing increments from $0 to $1000.

# Questions 

### Practice Question

We would like to begin with one practice question below. Your response to this question will not be recorded.

"If these were the only options available, would you choose to take the vaccine under the policy below (a $100 fine if you do not take the vaccine, a vaccination clinic 3 miles from your house, and $50 in cash) or choose to not take the vaccine?

**Mandate**: Vaccine mandated, $100 fine for non-compliance
**Accessibility**: Vaccination clinic will be located within 3 miles from your house
**Incentive**: $50 in cash"

- I will take the vaccine under these conditions.
- I will not take the vaccine under these conditions.

### Question 1

```{r , echo=FALSE}

alts <- jsonlite::fromJSON(df_json) %>% 
  filter(qID == 1)
alt1 <- alts %>% filter(altID == 1)
alt2 <- alts %>% filter(altID == 2)

```

- **Mandate**: `r alt1$penalty_label`

- **Incentive**: `r alt1$incentive_label`

- I will take the vaccine under these conditions.
- `r alt2$no_vaccine_label`

alt2 <- alts %>% filter(altID == 2)

```

- **Mandate**: `r alt1$penalty_label`
