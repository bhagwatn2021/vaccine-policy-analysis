# Abstract

This study focuses on the various policies that the US Federal government can enact to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates and stabilize the spread of COVID-19 with herd immunity. It compares a universal vaccine mandate, the policy in question, to various positive incentives, such as tax rebates, and neutral incentives that focus on increasing access to the vaccine. The target population for this study are all unvaccinated Americans. The policy attributes valuable to the customer that are considered are:

- Protection of individual rights
- Attributes of the policy (positive, negative, neutral)
- Amount of funds given/fined ($) 

# Introduction

Over 80 million Americans are unvaccinated for COVID-19, a disease that forced life to shut down and decimated the overall health and the economy of the US. Many unvaccinated Americans have numerous reservations against getting vaccinated, ranging from hesitancy due to mistrust in the American healthcare system, to political and religious oppositions. Every unvaccinated individual in the study is expected to respond to various policies, with some getting a vaccine, and others resisting the policies put in place.

On September 9th, 2021, US President Joe Biden announced vaccine mandates for 100 million Americans, including federal employees and private-sector employees part of firms with over 100 people. This has been met with praise from some experts who claim that forcing Americans to get vaccinated is crucial, criticism from other experts who claim that resistance to vaccine mandates will cause labor shortages and is not effective enough to vaccinate enough of the population [for herd immunity], and hostile resistance, particularly from conservatives, who attack the Constitutional provision of the mandates. [View this article to read some of the reactions to Biden's order.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/world/biden-covid-vaccine-requirements-reaction.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20210910&instance_id=40054&nl=the-morning&regi_id=77202080&segment_id=68558&te=1&user_id=9d1be558afe1d0264747cb1778f62d0a)

Vaccine mandates have been touted for months, since the COVID-19 vaccine has become available. But before they were enacted many state and local governments started giving out positive incentives such as money or commodities. All levels of government, from the federal government to local, enacted initiatives to increase access to the vaccine by fighting misinformation and setting up mobile vaccination sites.


# Target Population

There are approximately 80 million unvaccinated adults in the US. For each policy option, there is a different subset of populations that can potentially be impacted. Different groups of people and organizations have different opinions on each policy. If there is a negative policy (a mandate with a consequence for non-compliance), there is expected to be some resistance, especially from the far-right. But some people in the same sample group may be convinced to take a vaccine if there is a positive incentive for complying. Another reason for the lack of vaccinations is the mistrust that underprivileged groups have towards the American healthcare system. This is the result of microaggressions from providers towards marginalized patients*. The most efficient and effective way, as we hypothesize, is to enact neutral policies that focus on a more aggressive anti-mistrust campaign, including educating these groups of people on the safety and efficacy on the vaccine. To gain the best data possible, we will have to collect data on both the unvaccinated to vet how open the public is to getting vaccinated under different policies. To account for bias in our data, we will have to make sure that we survey people from a wide range of backgrounds, ranging by:

- Race/ethnicity*: this would be achieved by reaching out to various faith and culture-based organizations (Neel was on the Executive Board of Hindu Students Association during undergrad and is able to reach out to the MSSC.)
- Political beliefs: this would be achieved by reaching out political organizations to GW Young Americas Foundation, GW College Democrats, and GW College Republicans to get ample results from around the political compass. 
- Income*: this would be achieved by asking GW students and others who fill out the survey about their income, and comparing that against who would favor different policies over COVID vaccinations. We can also reach out to the financial aid office to get more responses from people of underprivileged backgrounds as we are not violating ethical standards by doing so.

We will also be reaching out to the following people/groups to diversify our sample: 

-Dr. Lorien Abroms, a Public Health professor, runs the GW Health Communications Corps, an organization combatting health misinformation. Dr. Abroms would particularly be integral with identifying groups of people that succumb to microaggressions and have lower vaccination rates*. Dr. Abroms can also help us gain more samples from groups that succumb to misinformation about the vaccine, as [a report from HHS in August 2021 estimates that 44% of unvaccinated fall into the "unvaccinated but willing" category](hhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/23/covid-unvaccinated-but-willing/?fbclid=IwAR26FWna18WL6-V__ofn441XM3cRf76NxEF6sWZdm-iNlO5q-his1OHocuk). This would help to reduce the bias in the sample towards a positive or negative policy, identifying a group of people that is willing to take the vaccine without any incentive or consequence wagered will help us identify the most efficient policy and whether incentives or fines are absolutely necessary. 
-Dr. Dennis Schell, a Psychology professor, teaches general and abnormal pyschology. He also works with people with adverse behavior issues, and will be able to help garner surveys from people with behavioral health issues on why they won't take the vaccine. With these people in our sample, we will be able to identify whether they can comply with a vaccine mandate. 
-Dr. Patrick McHugh is a Professor of Management. His research is focused on the psychology behind organizational structure and operations. He will be able to identify organizations that do not require vaccinations for its members, and give insight as to the reception towards vaccine mandates. He can also help us identify organizations that incentivize decisions, which we can send the survey to. 

*These factors are important because of the fact that people from underprivileged backgrounds are hesitant to take the vaccine because of mistrust in the American healthcare system. [A report by California State University, Northridge showcases and explains the disparities in vaccination rates amongst races](https://sundial.csun.edu/163812/news/vaccine-hesitancy-stands-in-the-way-of-reducing-covid-19-cases-in-communities-of-color/) 


*** IF TIME PERMITS *** 
It would be beneficial to collect supplemental data on businesses and influential people such as politicians because many businesses and politicians publish their stances on vaccines on common social media platforms such as Twitter. We would be gathering statements from a select few social media platforms and data about support for politicians and businesses (such as approval rating or popularity). Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have APIs that will give us a collection of posts from these groups. Moreover, we would also use the Pollster API to collect approval ratings from top politicians, and social media APIs to get a sense of how popular businesses are. This data will allow us to infer opinions for a larger portion of the population based on our surveys. We would compare results for different factors, and model it for others in the same sub-group. This would not be a completely effective model, however, when modeling consumer choice of ordinary American citizens. Given the political climate of the United States and the number of recorded incidents of mask resistance in stores, it would not be effective as pushback will lead to Americans not complying. The following videos depict the extent Americans' negative reactions to mandates:

# Policy Attributes

The policy attributes valuable to the government that are considered are:

- Protection of individual rights: far-right media hosts and politicians weaponize misinformation to provide a sense of government control and keep Americans skeptical about the vaccine. Mandates would make getting vaccinated a responsibility, while incentives would keep getting vaccinated an individual choice. 
- Reinforcement of the policy (positive, negative, neutral): positive policies will wager incentives such as monetary compensation or tangible gifts to those who get vaccinated. Neutral policies focus on increasing access to the vaccine with no reward or consequence. And negative policies involve mandates with fines or other penalties for non-compliance.
- Amount of funds given/fined ($): if a positive or negative policy is put in place, the amount of funds/goods wagered will influence the number of Americans that will comply.
